# Password-Generator
Password-Generator is an interactive application that generates a unique password based on user-selected criteria.

## Description 
Upon entering the application, users will be greeted with a simple yet polished page featuring an empty text box with a prominent "Generate Password" button right below.

Once the button is clicked, the user will be presented with a single prompt asking to choose a desired password length (between 8 and 128 characters). After a value is entered, the user will then be presented with 4 additional questions, which display in the following order:

    2. Do you want your password to include lowercase letters?
    3. Do you want your password to include uppercase letters?
    4. Do you want your password to include numbers?
    5. Do you want your password to include special characters?

If none of the above criteria is selected, a message will be displayed requiring the user to choose at least one character type or, alternatively, click cancel to exit. If the user opts to proceed, he or she will once again be guided through the questions until the requirement is met.

Similarly, if the user enters a numerical value either less than 8 or greater than 128, he or she will receive a message requiring satisfaction of the requirement to continue or, alternatively, opt to click cancel to exit the generator. 

Finally, once the user has selected his or her preferred criteria, a string of character selections is generated at random and displayed on the page.
