## Description 
Password-Generator is an interactive application that generates a unique password based on user-selected criteria. The application prompts the user with a variety of questions intended to determine the user's desired password criteria. These include: 

* How long would you like your password to be (value between 8 and 128 characters)
* Do you want your password to include lowercase letters?
* Do you want your password to include uppercase letters?
* Do you want your password to include numbers?
* Do you want your password to include special characters?

Once the user has responded to each of the prompts, a string of character selections is generated at random and displayed on the page.
